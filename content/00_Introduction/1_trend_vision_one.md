### What is Trend Vision One?

With today’s ever-evolving threat landscape, you need capabilities in place to help you detect and respond rapidly to threats that may breach your defenses.
Today, many organizations use multiple, separate security layers to detect threats across their email, endpoints, servers, cloud infrastructure, and networks, leading to siloed threat information and an overload of uncorrelated alerts.
Investigating threats across all these disparate solutions makes for a very piecemeal and manual investigation process that can miss threats altogether due to lack of visibility and correlation. Many detection and response solutions only look at endpoints, missing threats that pass through user emails, servers, cloud workloads, and networks. 

This results in a very limited view of the attacker’s activities and an inadequate, incomplete response.

Trend Micro Vision One provides advanced XDR capabilities that collect and automatically correlate data across multiple security layers; email, endpoints, servers, cloud workloads, and networks. 

Trend Micro prevents the majority of attacks with automated protection. This protection layer—coupled with the XDR capabilities that stitch together threat activity across layers—allow for the quick detection of complex attacks that bypass prevention. 

This provides a balanced approach to security as teams can quickly see the story of an attack and respond faster and more confidently. The visibility and efficiency that is provided by Trend Micro Vision One makes great security teams even better, enabling them to do more with less. 

In addition, the Trend Micro™ Managed XDR service can augment teams with expert threat hunting and investigation.

### Benefits

**Comprehensive protection**: Trend Micro detection and prevention (including web reputation, application control, and IPS) automatically stops more attacks before they take hold.

**Deeper Data**: Integrated, native sensors deliver deep activity data, not just detections, across email, endpoints, servers, cloud workloads, and networks.

**Enhanced Risk Visibility**: Includes role-based views of multiple security posture metrics and trends. Provides centralized visibility into such things as summary of key detections, endpoints with observable attack techniques, and prioritized lists of risky devices and users.
