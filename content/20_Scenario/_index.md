## Welcome to the Dunder Mifflen Team!


### Workshop Scenario: Securing Dunder Mifflin's Cloud Infrastructure

You've been hired by Dunder Mifflin, a fictional paper company, to improve the security of their cloud infrastructure on AWS. They have recently migrated their legacy systems to the cloud but are concerned about potential security threats and data breaches. Your task is to lead a workshop where participants will work through various security challenges to secure Dunder Mifflin's AWS environment.

### Workshop Objectives

1. **Secure the AWS Environment**: Participants must implement various security measures to protect Dunder Mifflin's AWS infrastructure, including the ECS/Fargate clusters, Lambda functions, cloud storage, and network architecture.

2. **Detect and Respond to Security Incidents**: Participants should set up monitoring and alerting to detect security incidents and develop an incident response plan.

3. **Compliance and Best Practices**: Emphasize adherence to AWS security best practices and compliance standards.

4. **Implement Security in the Pipeline**: Participants will spread security practices to the pipeline. Effectively Shifting security left.

## Scenario Phases

### Phase 1: Attack Surface Risk Mangement for Cloud: Assesment for Risk, Compliance and Best Practices
- Participants start with an assessment of the current security posture of Dunder Mifflin's AWS environment.
- Identify vulnerabilities and potential threats.
- Review and update AWS misconfiguration findings for compliance.
- Ensure adherence to AWS Well-Architected Framework.
- Prioritize Risk

### Phase 2: Become the Attacker
- Container Worklow:
- Serverless Workflow:
- Data Upload Workflow:

### Phase 3: XDR: Incident Detection and Response
- CloudTrail and Event Logs Insights.
- Assign models and respond to simulated security incidents.
- Develop an incident response plan.

### Phase 4: Cloud Protection
- Implement Policy based Security Measures at network, host and container.
- Malware Validation of data objects. 

### Phase 5: Shift Left: CICD Pipeline Security
- Ensure Security adherence and feedback loop in CICD Pipeline

## Key Takeaways

- The importance of proactively securing cloud infrastructure and container images.
- Practical experience in implementing security best practices.
- Hybrid Cloud Visibility
- The ability to detect and respond to cloud security incidents.
- Layered Security implementation of various workload types.
