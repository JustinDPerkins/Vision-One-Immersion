## Welcome to the Dunder Mifflen Team!


### Workshop Scenario: Securing Dunder Mifflin's Cloud Infrastructure

You've been hired by Dunder Mifflin, a fictional paper company, to improve the security of their cloud infrastructure on AWS. They have recently migrated their legacy systems to the cloud but are concerned about potential security threats and data breaches. Your task is to lead a workshop where participants will work through various security challenges to secure Dunder Mifflin's AWS environment.

### Workshop Objectives

1. **Secure the AWS Environment**: Participants must implement various security measures to protect Dunder Mifflin's AWS infrastructure, including the ECS/Fargate clusters, Lambda functions, cloud storage, and network architecture.

2. **Detect and Respond to Security Incidents**: Participants should set up monitoring and alerting to detect security incidents and develop an incident response plan.

3. **Compliance and Best Practices**: Emphasize adherence to AWS security best practices and compliance standards.

4. **Implement Security in the Pipeline**: Participants will spread security practices to the pipeline. Effectively Shifting security left.

## Scenario Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment
- Participants start with an assessment of the current security posture of Dunder Mifflin's AWS environment.
- Identify vulnerabilities and potential threats.
- Prioritize Risk.

### Phase 2: Secure the Environment
- Implement security groups, NACLs, and IAM policies.
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
- Set up VPC flow logs and CloudWatch alarms for key metrics.
- Implement identity and access management best practices.

### Phase 3: Incident Detection and Response
- Set up CloudTrail and Event Logs.
- Assign models and respond to simulated security incidents.
- Develop an incident response plan.

### Phase 4: Compliance and Best Practices
- Review and update AWS misconfiguration findings for compliance.
- Ensure adherence to AWS Well-Architected Framework.
- Discuss security best practices specific to the paper industry.


## Key Takeaways

- The importance of proactively securing cloud infrastructure.
- Practical experience in implementing AWS security best practices.
- The ability to detect and respond to security incidents.
- Awareness of compliance and industry-specific security considerations.
